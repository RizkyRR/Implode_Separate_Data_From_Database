# Implode_Separate_Data_From_Database
In this case, I want to combine a separate input into one sentence from the database (you can also watching my screenshot for detail)
First thing first we have to create variable $data (up to you, you can change it whatever do you want) then use function array() from php. 
Then we input separate data into array(). 



There you go
